NAME
    policyeditor - view and modify security policy settings for javaws and the browser plugin

SYNOPSIS
    policyeditor
    policyeditor [-file] policy_file

DESCRIPTION
    policyeditor is a GUI application with small command line support to view and edit applet security policy settings used by the IcedTea-Web implementation
    of javaws and the  browser plugin. It is intended as a simpler, easier to use, and more accessible alternative to the standard  JDK Policy Tool.
    Administrators and power users who need fine grained control over policy files should probably use Policy Tool instead of PolicyEditor.
    
    If executed without any arguments, no file is opened, and saving the file will result in a prompt on where to save it. Otherwise, if a file path is given
    as a command line argument, then that file path will be opened and parsed as policy file.


Missing Resource: manCommandLineOptions_en
    -codebase url                         - Specifies an applet codebase URL. This can be used with the other selector options to select a policy entry upon
    opening the editor; if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then selected.(Exactly one argument expected)
    -defaultfile                          - Specifies that the default user-level policy file should be opened. This is the file which is normally used by
    IcedTea-Web to make decisions about custom policies and permissions for applets at runtime, unless configured otherwise.(No argument expected)
    -file policy_file                     - Specifies a policy file path to open. If exactly one argument is given, and it is not this flag, it is interpreted
    as a file path to open, as if this flag was given first. This flag exists mostly for compatibility with Policy Tool.(Exactly one argument expected)
    -help                                 - Prints out information about supported command and basic usage.(No argument expected)
    -principals class_name principal_name - Specifies class name/principal name pairs (space-separated) for the policy entry identifier. This can be used with
    the other selector options to select a policy entry upon opening the editor; if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then
    selected.(Expected even number of arguments with param=value as valid argument)
    -signedby certificate_alias           - Specifies a certificate alias for a certificate stored in the keystore. This can be used with the other selector
    options to select a policy entry upon opening the editor; if no such identifier exists then it will be created and then selected.(Exactly one argument
    expected)
    -verbose                              - Enable verbose output.(No argument expected)

EXAMPLES
    policyeditor                                                         - Show the GUI editor with no file opened.
    policyeditor -file %XDG_CONFIG_HOME\icedtea-web\security\java.policy - Show GUI and open the default policy file.

FILES
    %XDG_CACHE_HOME\icedtea-web\cache\recently_used.cache - Additional information about items in cache
    %XDG_CONFIG_HOME\icedtea-web\security\java.policy     - Contains granted permissions for selected unsigned apps. Controlled by
    deployment.user.security.policy
    Where $XDG_CONFIG_DIR, $XDG_CACHE_DIR and $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR are  set  as ~/.config, ~/.cache and /tmp or /var/tmp if not set.

BUGS
    There aren't any known bugs. If you come across one, please file it at:
    http://icedtea.classpath.org/wiki/IcedTea-Web#Filing_bugs
    https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/icedtea-web/issues
    
    Please run in debug (-verbose switch or itw-settings setting or ICEDTEAPLUGIN_DEBUG variable set to true) mode and include that output (best is from the
    console) with URL to jnlp or html file (or the jnlp/html file or  application itself) when filling out the bug report.
